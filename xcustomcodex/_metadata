  "description" : "Replaces the stock codex with a custom, much better codex. This is designed to work with a custom codex storage system. It does not hook into player discoveries, but does listen to whenever you use a codex item.\n\nhttps://github.com/XanTheDragon/XCustomCodex\n\nThis supports all vanilla codex entries out of the box. It also has stock support for custom races -- no need to update the race mod either!\n\nTo view the new codex, install Quickbar Mini (it adds a quickbar button) or use /admin followed by /spawnitem xcodexlogbook and use this item. An update to add this to bookshelves is planned, if this is possible.",
